## 🏗️ Architecture

Think Fast follows a **layered architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

```

├── core/                        # Core services & utilities
│   ├── audio/                   # Audio playback service
│   ├── haptic/                  # Haptic feedback service

│   └── round_result.dart        # Complete round results
├── services/                    # Business logic

├── screens/                     # UI pages

│   ├── game_screen.dart         # Active gameplay
│   └── result_screen.dart       # Post-round statistics
└── widgets/                     # Reusable UI components
    ├── answer_button.dart       # Answer selection buttons
    ├── countdown_widget.dart    # Countdown timer display
    ├── question_card.dart       # Question display component
    └── ...
```

### Design Principles

1. **Pure Dart Game Engine**
   - `GameEngine` class contains all game logic with **zero Flutter dependencies**
   - Easier to test, reuse, and maintain
   - UI layer observes engine state via callbacks

2. **Service Layer**
   - `AudioService` — Centralized audio playback management
   - `HapticService` — Unified haptic feedback API
   - Single instance pattern for singleton services

3. **Immutable Models**
   - `Question`, `QuestionResult`, `RoundResult` use final fields
   - Predictable state management

4. **UI Composition**
   - Reusable widgets (`AnswerButton`, `CountdownWidget`, etc.)
   - Stateful screens for local state management
   - Clear separation between presentation and logic

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Round Flow

1. **Setup Phase**: Player selects number of rounds (default: 5)
2. **Round Start**: 60-second timer begins
3. **Question Loop** (repeats until timer expires):
   - Display random addition: `a + b` (0–9 + 0–9)
   - Player taps "Even" or "Odd"
   - Game records: response time + correctness
   - Next question appears immediately
4. **Round End**: Display round statistics
5. **Game Over**: Show cumulative stats across all rounds

### Question Model

```dart
// Example: 7 + 5 = 12 (even)
Question(a: 7, b: 5)
  .result         // 12
  .isEven         // true
  .correctAnswer  // 0 (0 = Even)
```

### Scoring & Statistics

For each question, the game tracks:
- ✅/❌ Correctness
- ⏱️ Response time (accurate to 0.01s)
- 📊 Accuracy percentage per round
- 🎯 Total questions answered

```

#### Generate App Bundle (Google Play)

```bash
flutter build appbundle --release

# Output: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

#### Sign APK Manually (if needed)

```bash
# Generate keystore (do this once, keep it safe!)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/key.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -alias android_key -storepass password -keypass password

# Sign APK
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 \
  -keystore ~/key.jks \
  build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk android_key
```

### Code Style

- Follow [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `dart format` to auto-format
- Run `flutter analyze` before committing

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "flutter: command not found"
```bash
# Add Flutter to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
```

#### "No devices found"
```bash
# List Android devices
flutter devices

# Start Android emulator
# Open Android Studio → Device Manager → Create Virtual Device
```

#### "Android build fails"
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Check Android setup
flutter doctor --android-licenses

# Accept Android licenses
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

#### "Audio not playing"
- Verify audio files are in [assets/audio/](assets/audio/)
- Check [pubspec.yaml](pubspec.yaml) asset declarations
- Rebuild with `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

- Flutter team for the amazing framework
- Audio assets from [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org)
